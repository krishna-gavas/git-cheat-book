## 1-1 Git Basics
So, what is Git in a nutshell? This is an important section to absorb, because if you understand what
Git is and the fundamentals of how it works, then using Git effectively will probably be much easier
for you. As you learn Git, try to clear your mind of the things you may know about other VCSs, such
as CVS, Subversion or Perforce — doing so will help you avoid subtle confusion when using the tool.
Even though Git’s user interface is fairly similar to these other VCSs, Git stores and thinks about
information in a very different way, and understanding these differences will help you avoid
becoming confused while using it.

## Snapshots, Not Differences
The major difference between Git and any other VCS (Subversion and friends included) is the way
Git thinks about its data. Conceptually, most other systems store information as a list of file-based
changes. These other systems (CVS, Subversion, Perforce, Bazaar, and so on) think of the
information they store as a set of files and the changes made to each file over time (this is
commonly described as delta-based version control).

Git doesn’t think of or store its data this way. Instead, Git thinks of its data more like a series of
snapshots of a miniature filesystem. With Git, every time you commit, or save the state of your
project, Git basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a
reference to that snapshot. To be efficient, if files have not changed, Git doesn’t store the file again,
just a link to the previous identical file it has already stored. Git thinks about its data more like a
stream of snapshots.

This is an important distinction between Git and nearly all other VCSs. It makes Git reconsider
almost every aspect of version control that most other systems copied from the previous
generation. This makes Git more like a mini filesystem with some incredibly powerful tools built on
top of it, rather than simply a VCS. We’ll explore some of the benefits you gain by thinking of your
data this way when we cover Git branching in Git Branching.
