### 2-1-1 Initializing a Repository in an Existing Directory

If you have a project directory that is currently not under version control and you want to start
controlling it with Git, you first need to go to that project’s directory. If you’ve never done this, it
looks a little different depending on which system you’re running:

```
$ cd /<path to project>/my_project
```

and type:

```
$ git init
```

This creates a new subdirectory named `.git` that contains all of your necessary repository files — a
Git repository skeleton. At this point, nothing in your project is tracked yet.

If you want to start version-controlling existing files (as opposed to an empty directory), you should
probably begin tracking those files and do an initial commit. You can accomplish that with a few
`git add` commands that specify the files you want to track, followed by a `git commit`:

```
$ git add *.c
$ git add LICENSE
$ git commit -m 'initial project version'
``` 

We’ll go over what these commands do in just a minute. At this point, you have a Git repository
with tracked files and an initial commit.
