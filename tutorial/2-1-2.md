### 2-1-2 Cloning an Existing Repository

If you want to get a copy of an existing Git repository — for example, a project you’d like to
contribute to — the command you need is `git clone`.Every version of every file for the history of the project is pulled down by default
when you run `git clone`. In fact, if your server disk gets corrupted, you can often use nearly any of
the clones on any client to set the server back to the state it was in when it was cloned.

You clone a repository with `git clone <url>`. For example, if you want to clone the Git linkable
library called libgit2, you can do so like this:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2
```

That creates a directory named `libgit2`, initializes a `.git` directory inside it, pulls down all the data
for that repository, and checks out a working copy of the latest version. If you go into the new
`libgit2` directory that was just created, you’ll see the project files in there, ready to be worked on or
used.

If you want to clone the repository into a directory named something other than `libgit2`, you can
specify the new directory name as an additional argument:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2 mylibgit
```

That command does the same thing as the previous one, but the target directory is called mylibgit.
