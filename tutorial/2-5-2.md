### 2-5-2 Adding Remote Repositories

We’ve mentioned and given some demonstrations of how the `git clone` command implicitly adds the `origin` remote for you. Here’s how to add a new remote explicitly. To add a new remote Git repository as a shortname you can reference easily, run `git remote add <shortname> <url>`:

```
$ git remote
origin
$ git remote add pb https://github.com/paulboone/ticgit
$ git remote -v
origin https://github.com/schacon/ticgit (fetch)
origin https://github.com/schacon/ticgit (push)
pb https://github.com/paulboone/ticgit (fetch)
pb https://github.com/paulboone/ticgit (push)
```

Now you can use the string `pb` on the command line in lieu of the whole URL. For example, if you want to fetch all the information that Paul has but that you don’t yet have in your repository, you can run `git fetch pb`:

```
$ git fetch pb
remote: Counting objects: 43, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (36/36), done.
remote: Total 43 (delta 10), reused 31 (delta 5)
Unpacking objects: 100% (43/43), done.
From https://github.com/paulboone/ticgit
 * [new branch] master -> pb/master
 * [new branch] ticgit -> pb/ticgit
```

Paul’s master branch is now accessible locally as `pb/master` — you can merge it into one of your branches, or you can check out a local branch at that point if you want to inspect it.
